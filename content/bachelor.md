The thesis was titled “Video Processing Application for Intelligent Traffic Monitoring using Optical Flow Technique.” 

The system is built by designing computer vision software with OpenCV and set to run on a Windows computer. The computer vision software is created using optical flow technique with Pyramid Image Lucas-Kanade algorithm. The optical flow is calculating the instantaneous velocity by comparing the motion of vehicle in two successive frames. The next step is calculating the average velocity by averaging the instantaneous velocity over a desired time interval. Then the system classifies the traffic density based on the average velocity. The traffic information can be accessed over web in mobile browser.

The accuracy of the system is 78.96% at day and 41.91% at night. System can successfully measure the average velocity and the road density of  Dr. Djundjunan street in Bandung and both information can be accessed easily over mobile browser.
