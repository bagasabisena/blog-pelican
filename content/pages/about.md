Summary: About me

Hi! Selamat Datang! My name is Bagas Abisena Swastanto from Indonesia. It is very hard to write about myself here, seriously. My wife describes me as a classic introvert, and I really think so too. I have an unusual affection to technology and that leads to the path of Engineering. Currently a master student in the Netherlands. Oh, I also a big fan of Manchester United. Hope you enjoy my blog!
