Cravn is social mobile application where people can share their wishes and plans (we call it “cravn” from the word “crave”) in the future through the application. The aim of the application is to build a recommendation based on user’s preference, by using the popularity of the cravn (could be an activity, movie, food, stuff, or book), the quality of cravn’s review from previous users, and the relationship between users as the input. For example, user A wants to watch movie Y tomorrow and shares his wish to his friends. His friends can react to his interest. When user A finishes watching the movie, he could give review about the movie for other users’ reference.

The team behind the application consisted of three people. I am the developer in charge to build up the whole system, backend and mobile application frontend. The backend is built using Python-Django Framework and the database used is Neo4J graph database. The mobile application is built on Android platform using native (Java) API. 

## Activities:

* develop REST API endpoint using Django framework
* develop database using Neo4j graph database
* develop recommendation engine using Python
* develop client app in Android using Android native (Java)

## Video Demo:

Here is the video demo that we made for INAICTA 2013 competition. Unfortunately the video voiceover is in Bahasa Indonesia.
